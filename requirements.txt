# No external libraries are required.
# This project uses only Python's standard library:
# - tkinter (for the UI)
# - sqlite3 (for the database)
# - os

# You just need to have Python installed.
# On Windows, make sure to check "tcl/tk and IDLE" during installation if it's not selected by default (usually it is).
